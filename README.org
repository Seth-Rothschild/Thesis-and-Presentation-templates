These are =.tex= templates built from [[http://www.tomrbenson.com/][Tom Benson's]]
=mytuftsthesis.cls= file and loosely based on the entirety
of the template which can be found on the [[https://sites.google.com/site/tuftsogsm/resources/latex-tools][Tufts Organization
of Graduate Students in Mathematics]] website.

The primary change for the thesis template is that I've put
the entire document in one file. This means that there's
only one file to save edit and compile, which reduced the
number of times I tried to compile something with an empty
header. For navigation, if you're in emacs, you can use 
=outline-mode= to collapse chapters when you're not working on them.

The presentation template is completely different from
previous versions and is based on the [[https://github.com/matze/mtheme][Metropolis Theme.]]
