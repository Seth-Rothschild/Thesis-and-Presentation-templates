These are =.tex= templates built from [[http://www.tomrbenson.com/][Tom Benson's]]
=mytuftsthesis.cls= file and loosely based on the entirety
of the template which can be found on the [[https://sites.google.com/site/tuftsogsm/resources/latex-tools][Tufts Organization
of Graduate Students in Mathematics]] website.

The primary change for the thesis template is that I've put
the entire document in one file. This means that there's
only one file to save edit and compile, which reduced the
number of times I tried to compile something with an empty
header. For navigation, if you're in emacs, you can use 
=outline-mode= to collapse chapters.

The presentation template is completely different from
previous versions and is based on the [[https://github.com/matze/mtheme][Metropolis Theme.]]
Given that most beamer outerthemes [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/357386/how-to-remove-an-extra-hline-in-beamerouterthememiniframes][do not play nicely with
anti-aliasing]] this is the only viable modern option.

I have a short guide to customization in the header of the
file, along with some nice Tufts compatable colors
pre-defined. The template also has examples of basic beamer
usage and hidden slides.
